# GraphQL:
	
GraphQL is a query language for APIs.
Graphql is a Specification meaning that software requirements specification(SRS) is a document that describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform. But as a developer we are not going to use specification we are going to use same implementation of a specification.

GraphQL parts:
   * Schema Definition Language (Schema is MANDATORY)
   * Query Language

Dependencies:
   * graphql-java - Implementation of GraphQL in java language (Core Engineer)
   * graphql-java-kickstart - Exposes the Engineer to get started with GraphQL.
